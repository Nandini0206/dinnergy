## Our Process

We agreed to follow an Agile Software Development process using Extreme Programming framework at the start of the 2-week development period. We carried this out via daily standups - one in the morning and one in the afternoon, regular retrospectives (at least 2-3 per week), and planned our 2-day sprints as a team, making sure each team member was clear on our collective aim.
